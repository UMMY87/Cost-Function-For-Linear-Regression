# Cost-Function-For-Linear-Regression
This Python code integrates numpy and matplotlib to explore the concept of cost function in linear regression, specifically using an interactive visualization setup that incorporates custom utility functions for educational purposes. The script starts by importing necessary modules, configuring the matplotlib style for consistent aesthetics, and defining training data that represents house sizes (in thousands of square feet) and their corresponding prices (in thousands of dollars).

The core function, `compute_cost`, calculates the cost function for linear regression. This function takes as input the features `x`, target values `y`, and the model parameters weight `w` and bias `b`. It iterates over each training example to compute the sum of squared differences between predicted values and actual targets, which quantifies the prediction error. This total error is averaged and scaled to provide the cost, a measure of model accuracy.

The code further uses several visualization functions (like `plt_intuition` and `plt_stationary`) from custom modules (`lab_utils_common` and `lab_utils_uni`) designed to provide a graphical intuition of how changes in parameters `w` and `b` affect the model's predictions and overall cost. These functions typically generate static and dynamic plots that help users visually understand the impact of linear regression parameters on fitting data. The script concludes with an interactive element (`plt_update_onclick`), allowing users to manually adjust model parameters via clicks on a plot to observe changes in the regression line and the resulting cost dynamically. Additionally, the `soup_bowl` function likely visualizes the cost surface, commonly used to represent the cost function in two parameters' space, illustrating how optimization techniques like gradient descent could find the minimum cost. This educational toolset is ideal for learners to grasp the fundamental concepts of machine learning through interactive visualizations.
